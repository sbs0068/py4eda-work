    "This assignment transitions you from NumPy's numerical array operations to Pandas' powerful tabular data manipulation. While NumPy excels at homogeneous numerical arrays, Pandas is designed for the heterogeneous, labeled data that characterizes most real-world datasets—mixing dates, categories, numbers, and text within the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work with real bike share data from Chicago's Divvy system to answer questions about urban transportation patterns. Through three progressively complex problems—exploring usage patterns, analyzing rider behavior, and conducting temporal analysis—you'll discover why Pandas has become the standard tool for data analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment emphasizes Pandas' design philosophy: named column access, explicit indexing methods (loc/iloc), handling missing data, and method chaining for readable data pipelines. You'll also see how Pandas builds on NumPy while adding the structure and convenience needed for practical data science work.\n",

    "2. 'df['price']' would return a series because it is in a one-dimensional format, which implies a series. While 'df[['price']]' is multidimensional, so it must become a dataframe. The first one is asking for a single column, while the other is asking for a dataframe of the list of names.\n",
    "3.  Using specific index names would be useful when you want both column and row names in something and did not want a spare column taking up unnecesasry space. It makes indexing more intuitive as well. For example, if you have a large table and one of the columns is city names with no repetitions. That might be better to have the city names as the indexes for convenience."

First objects would be much more difficult to work with in numeric operations, a key thing for date time values, and they are not ideal for processing catagorical data in say boolean form either. Secondly, this would take up a lot of unneccessary space.\n",
    "2. The IDs were most likely generated using hashing.\n",
    "3. Method chaining is like sequencing operations to happen on a dataset and then running them all in a row.Each method operating on the result of the prior. df.isna().sum() for example, works by finding all of the null values in each column of a dataframe (df) and then summing them. It then returns a Series with column names as the index.\n",
    "4. It is possible these were not always returned to stations. It is very common with these type of rideshare programs for the bikes to simply be abandoned somewhere besides their stations. It is also possible they made it to the station area, but there was not room for them to actually be stored at the station. So they were abandoned close to them. The rows with these missing values could still be informative. So I think I would remove them but store them in a seperate dataset to be examined alongside the main one. Another option is to use the coordinates listed and simply assign the stations closest to the coordinates for the station information."

    "2. The first reason is that it eliminated the need for a third assignment after the other two. The second is that it created the correct datatype for the column, making it easy to add additional values. The third is that it is much easier to initialize a column with a single value than to attempt all the assignments at once. If the categories were assigned in a different order, more indexing would have been required to list all of the midday times, which were more difficult to group and could have resulted in some being missed. If a default had not been set, the datatype might have required manipulation, or the same issue with indexing midday values could have arisen.\n",
    "3. I would choose query() when I am confident in the formatting of my data and column names and when I am dealing with a smaller check. I would use boolean indexing when there is a greater likelihood of error or when column names are unconventional. Boolean indexing is more explicit about what is being done, which makes debugging easier."

I recently signed an offer to be a Quality Engineer at Neptune Technologies Group when I graduate, so I feel using these tools for analyzing defect counts in different conditions and occurance times could be very useful in the future.\n",
    "b. I feel I am a 6.5 out of 10 in preparedness to use Pandas on my own data.
